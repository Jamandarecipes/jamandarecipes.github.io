Mix to dissolve the sugar very well.\n\n\nBring the pot to medium heat. Right when the mixture starts to boil, time 5 minutes of boiling time. Then add in the orange and rose water as well as a squeeze of lemon juice into the pot. \n\n\nContinue to boil for 2 more minutes.

Cover with a damp towel, not wet, to prevent it from drying.\n\n\nBrush the base of a 9 x 14 inch pan with some ghee. Place one sheet of phyllo and brush again with ghee. Repeat to get a total of 15 sheets, brushing ghee in between each sheet. Add in half of the ground pistachio and spread evenly.\n\n\nAdd in one sheet over the nuts and brush by dabbing only because it will move if you brush it normally. Add 9 more sheets, total 10 sheets, brushing in between each sheet. Press press down the surface very well with your palm to compress the nuts. \n\n\nAdd the other half of the ground pistachio and top with 15 more sheets the same way you did the first layer. Before brushing the top with ghee for the last time, press down the surface really well again with your palm to compress the layers. \n\n\nUsing a sharp knife with a pointed tip, cut the baklava into diamond shapes. Refer to my blog photos for step-by-step photo reference.\n\n\nPlace the tray on the middle rack of your oven and bake for 40 minutes. At this point the edges and baklava should be lightly brown in color and you can turn on the top broiler for just 1-2 minutes watching it \"very closely\" until you get the golden color you prefer. Do not take your eyes off of it or else they will burn super fast.\n\n\nRemove from the oven and drizzle the simple syrup evenly all over the baklava.

I did not have enough of it!\nThe gen 3 games have a few defined spaces in the players save file for info obtained externally. \nThese are things like secret bases from other players, other players battle tower teams, and yes, information from the E-Reader.\nThe space defined for the Eon Ticket, specifically, is called RamScript. It’s 995 bytes in size. \nFor my first 6 events, I stored all my data in that location. This includes text, script commands, and assembly code. This is hardly ideal. \nI played around with other storage solutions, but today I’m going to write about the best one I’ve found, and how to utilize it. \nWhen a Gen 3 game saves, it transfers data from the GBAs RAM to the flash memory chip on the cartridge. \nThey also divided this flash memory chip into several sectors. Each sector is 4096 bytes, although some are lumped together. \nSectors 0-13 are for your save file.\nSectors 14-28 are for the backup of your save file\nAnd sector 29 is for your hall of fame data.\nIn Ruby &amp; Sapphire, 30 and 31 are entirely unused. \nIn Emerald, 31 is used for the battle record feature. But 30 is still unused. Or, it is, but only in international copies. \n30 is used in Japanese Emerald &amp; FRLG to store the custom trainer hill data from E-Cards. \nThis space is both unused &amp; never written to normally by the game. This means it’s 4kb of space the player can’t accidently write to by using the battle tower!\nThe game has premade functions to read from and write to the flash chip, so we don’t have to do a lot of work to use it. \nLet’s talk about writing, first. \nI use TryWriteSector, &amp; it has 2 arguments. \n\nWhich flash memory section are we using. In our case, 0x1E, aka 30.\nWhere is the data in RAM to flash?\n\nThen, when called, it writes 4096 bytes from the location you input in as the argument are written to that flash sector. \nWhen RSE connects to the E-Reader the entire e-card gets sent through the link cable into RSEs WRAM. \nThe game then looks for what’s called a “preload” script in the e-card. This is a section that runs the games scripting language commands, meant to check if the data is okay to send over.\nThe Eon Ticket, for example, checks if you already have an Eon Ticket in your bag. \nCrucially, though, it does not have a size limit.\nSo, what I do is store tons of data in the preload script. One of those being a small assembly program that sets up then calls TryWriteSector. \nLet’s take a look at what that looks like for me. This is all done using the Eon Ticket disassembly by hacky.\nAfter DataStart, I set up the preloadscript.\n\nPreloadScriptStart is where we’ll be working from, from now on. \n\nThis is the start of my preload script. callasm $02000045 jumps the game to WriteFlashMemory. Crucially, it’s after “end”, so the thumb code never gets read as script commands. \nWriteFlashMemory is the thumb assembly code I wrote to actually call TryWriteSector. It’s stored as machine code in an include file with the macros for the script commands. \nI’ll note that in Emerald, if you copy this code, the callasm should be 0201C045 instead. Emeralds spot it loads the E-Reader into is slightly different. \nHere’s what the actual code looks like:\n\nIt’s a very simple bit of code since I’m just setting up the registers for a built-in function of the game. \nAfter WriteFlashMemory, I have a bunch of code &amp; data I want to store in the unused flash memory section. \n\nAfter this the usual ramscript information begins! This is what triggers when you talk to an NPC, and it’s labeled “NormanScript”, because it’s a hack of the Eon Ticket, and you receive that from Norman. \nThis script uses several “callasm” calls, which relies on info that is within the unused flash memory section.\nThat data is not loaded into RAM anywhere by default, so we have to run a function to pull it from the flash memory section!\nIn Ruby &amp; Sapphire, since there is no Address Space Layout Randomization, I store the thumb code I need directly in RamScript near the top, like so:\n\nLet’s take a look at READFLASH. It works similarly to WriteFlashMemory, as we’re just setting up a different in-game function. It’s called DoReadFlashWholeSection in PokeRuby, &amp; ReadFlashSector in PokeEmerald.\n\nI chose 0201b201 as it doesn’t seem to be a space the game uses, but I can’t guarantee!\nBut once this thumb runs, all my code &amp; data is loaded to that space and my script can continue.\nObviously, in Emerald, this won’t work. What I do instead is store this code as writebytetoaddr commands. This, in a way, builds the thumb code live somewhere in Emeralds RAM that isn’t in ASLR space. \nEach command does what it says on the tin-- it writes the byte specified to the address specified. \nI tend to choose gEnemyParty for this, since it’s usually not in use when I’m talking to an NPC!\n\nThis is what that looks like! \nIt does eat 96 bytes into my payload, but I’m not really sure there’s a better way for Emerald. \nSpeaking of Emerald, I’ve actually taken to storing most of my events in this space, rather than ramscript. Since all the data at 0201b201 isn’t subject to ASLR, I can have the player get into battles &amp; do other things without the typical worries I’d have. \nMy Celebi event, for example, only has code in RamScript to init the unused flash memory section. All the dialogue, script, etc, is stored in the unused flash section. \n\nThat’s RamScript for Celebi. Nothing else! \nHere’s what’s in the Preload Script! It's the full source to my Celebi Event in Emerald. In Ruby &amp; Sapphire, all of this would be within RamScript itself. \n\nI think, generally, using the Unused Flash Memory section is superior to storing data elsewhere in R/S/E, and if you’re going to do any Eon Ticket hack like I have, try to use this technique for storage instead!\nFeel free to contact me if you’re trying to use this and have any questions.
